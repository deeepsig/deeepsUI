# DeeepsUI Demos

This is going to be a gallery where I can experiment with different interactions and interfaces. For starters, we have a very simple canvas interaction closely resembling that of Claude, but as we go on there'll be better interaction concepts in it. I'm still more of an interface guy rather than an interaction god like some I know online.

## Tech Stack

Built with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, and Prettier.

## Getting Started

To experiment with them:

1. Clone or download the repo
2. Run `npm run dev`

> **Note:** I'll add a better way to see through the different examples later.
